My goals for this project were to:
1. Learn how to manage a database using MySQL
2. Create the back-end using PHP
3. Further develop my front-end programming skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

*Note: This was my first web project involving a front-end and back-end, which is why I had not implemented proper password encryption, SQL Injection prevention, cross-site scripting prevention and other security measures.
